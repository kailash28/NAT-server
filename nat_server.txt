HOW TO INSTALL AND CONFIGURE NAT SERVER ON LINUX USING IPTABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------
step1: install two network interfaces with different ip domains
and make sure they both should be active and should show in route -n
step2: determine the interface name for setup the internal and external
network(eg 192.168.46.226 for external(for connecting the internet)
and 10.0.3.15 for internal network) 
step3: now make the ip static on both the network card and enable the 
	ip forwarding
	TO CHECK IP FORWARDING	
	--	sysctl -a | grep ip_forward
		make the entry in /etc/sysctl.conf as 
		net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
step4: configure the network
	open /etc/sysconfig/network file 
	and make the entries like
	NETWORKING=yes
	HOSTNAME=nat
	GATEWAY=192.168.43.1	#gateway of external network
step5: check the dns configuration 
	open /etc/resolv.conf file and check the name and ip 
	of nameserver
 step6: use iptables to setup the nat server by these commands
	iptables --flush 
	iptables --table nat --flush
	iptables --delete-chain
	iptables --table nat --delete-chain
	iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE
	iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth1 -j ACCEPT
 	service iptables restart
step7: to check the nat tables 
	iptables -t nat -n -L -v
step7: go to client and make the network as nat and check the ip
	(ip should be in 10.0._.)
	check the nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf
	this should be same as nat server file
step8: try to ping to gateway of external network i.e. 192.168.43.1

step9: try to ping the google.com

this is full working process for NAT server.
